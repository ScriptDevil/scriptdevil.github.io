      <p>
        I did a tiny experiment a few days back. I checked how much I
        had accumulated in terms of notes over the past year and a bit.
        Turns out I had written less than 8MB of text - and this
        includes a lot of content that I had copy-pasted in.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now, I thought of time I had wasted beautifying my previous
        blog. The amount of time I wasted optimizing how the
        output of my flavor-of-the-month static site generator/CSS
        framework looked. And for what? I don't know a single
        person other than me who read the blog. </p>

      <p>
        That got me thinking. Why did I use a static site generator in the
        first place (other than the convenience of using markdown?). Turns out
        I had to find some way of templating the stuff around the actual
        articles I wrote. The bloat was a side-effect of me not having to focus
        on everything that was being served but only the content I wrote. The
        static assets on my previous attempt at a blog took over 4MB. I had
        only written 300kB of actual content in that site.</p>

      <p>
        So the lightbulb went off, what if I didn't need to copy the template
        over and over into each post I wrote? What if ... there was
        only one page? Ooh! Aren't <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application">SPA</a>s
        all the rage?
      </p>

      <p>
        So there goes! Welcome to this SPA. Every post lives here. I
        have done by best not to cripple the site on purpose. I use sans-serif
        font because it is better on the eyes, but I don't force you to use a
        particular font. I have a maintain a <a href="#postlist">list of
          posts</a> at the top that you can use to navigate or jump to posts of
        your choice. I still have tags. Simply search for
        <code>tag-NameOfTheTag</code>. Each post heading will still be
        a link so that you can quickly copy a reference to the link if
        you want to.
      <p>

      <p>
        Yes, it is an ugly beast. But it is my ugly beast! If you use a
        text-mode browser like w3m or links, you shouldn't notice a difference.
        If you really want to switch over fonts, background colors, width, or
        even voice narration(!), I would strongly urge you to use <a
          href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Mozilla Firefox</a> and its excellent <a
          href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-reader-view-clutter-free-web-pages">Reader
          View</a> (which also works on your phone!)
      </p>

      <p>
        Aggregators like <a href="https://reddit.com">Reddit</a>,
        <a href="https://news.ycombinator.org">HN</a> or <a href="https://lobste.rs">Lobste.rs</a> might have a hard
        time
        since the only part of the URL that changes between posts is the
        anchor (<code>https://scriptdevil.in/<u>#post-name</u></code>). But
        then again, it isn't like I am making frontpage everyday. So who
        cares? There is also the problem of being indexed properly by search
        pages. Meh!
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you load this page. You get to read everything I have written here
        offline! So, my genius has inadvertently added in another
        <em>feature</em> - we are not just
        an SPA, but also a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_app">PWA</a>!
        Beat that.
